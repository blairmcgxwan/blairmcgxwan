### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--




- Hey, I'm Blair! I'm pretty new to all of this, and I don't have any experience with it, but I'm excited to learn, as code and working with computers has always interested me! :grinning: 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics, so bare with me on my journey, and any advice or pointers is always appreciated!
- A bit about me I guess, well, I like to snowboard, I spent 4 years living in British Columbia, Canada working as a Snowboard Instructor and doing some freestyle coaching. I'm also a big fan of music, riding bikes and nerding out on movies :movie_camera:
- You can ask me anything, I don't mind, I'm a pretty open book!
- Fun facts? Well... I love cats, but I also love dogs... and a variety of other animals.. So I guess, maybe one day, I'll just need to find a nice big barn to convert so that they all have plenty space, and I'm nice and secluded in the country...
